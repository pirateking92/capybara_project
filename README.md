## Capybara Project

In this second engineering project at Makers, our team of 7 was tasked with
working on an existing application, which is a Facebook clone.
The existing app and its legacy code was simple in its output, but had a lot
of code that we as a team had to go through, understand and teach each other about.

Our goal was to **improve and extend** the codebase, making features that were
already there better, and adding features where we saw they were needed.

What is here now is a forked version of what was acheived in the two weeks we were given,
and includes continuation from myself.

What follows is the information that was given to us at the beginning of the project.

Let's see what i can add! :)

### Structure

This repo contains two applications:

- A frontend React App
- A backend api server

These two applications will communicate through HTTP requests, and need to be
run separately.

### Documentation

[More documentation of the codebase and its architecture can be found here.](./DOCUMENTATION.md)
It's recommended you all read the suggested docs _after making sure the whole
setup below worked for everyone_. Then work together on a diagram describing how
the application works.

### Quickstart

### Install Node.js

If you haven't already, make sure you have node and NVM installed.

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
   Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), (`20.5.0` at
   time of writing).
   ```
   nvm install 20
   ```

### Install Go

Follow the instructions here: https://go.dev/doc/install

### Set up your project

1. Have one team member fork this repository
2. Rename the fork to `acebook-<team name>`
3. Every team member clone the fork to their local machine
4. Install dependencies for both the `frontend` and `api` applications:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../api
   go get .
   ```
5. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor, for example
   [ESLint for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
6. Start Postgresql

   ```
   brew services start postgresql
   ```

7. Create your databases:
   ```
   createdb acebook
   createdb acebook_test
   ```

### Setting up environment variables.

We need to create two `.env` files, one in the frontend and one in the api.

#### Frontend

Create a file `frontend/.env` with the following contents:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8082"
```

#### Backend

Create a file `api/.env` with the following contents:

```
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/acebook"
JWT_SECRET="secret"
```

For an explanation of these environment variables, see the documentation.

### How to run the server and use the app

1. Start the server application (in the `api` directory) in dev mode:

```
; cd api
; go run main.go
```

2. Start the front end application (in the `frontend` directory)

In a new terminal session...

```
; cd frontend
; npm run dev
```

You should now be able to open your browser and go to the
`http://localhost:5173/signup` to create a new user.

Then, after signing up, you should be able to log in by going to
`http://localhost:5173/login`.

After logging in, you won't see much but you can create posts using PostMan and
they should then show up in the browser if you refresh the page.
